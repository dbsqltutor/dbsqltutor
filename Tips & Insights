            <p>
                Learning SQL and understanding how databases really work becomes much easier when concepts are explained
                clearly and in the right order. This section is where I share short, practical insights on SQL, databases,
                and data modeling — the same principles I use when tutoring students one‑on‑one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each tip focuses on one idea at a time. Some are beginner‑friendly fundamentals, others explore intermediate
                techniques, and some dive into advanced reasoning used in real‑world systems. The goal is always the same:
                to help you build clarity, structure, and confidence in how you think about data.
            </p>
            <p>
                New tips are added regularly. Below are a few example topics you’ll see here:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Why <code>SELECT *</code> hurts performance more than you think</li>
                <li>INNER vs LEFT JOIN — when each one makes sense</li>
                <li>How to translate real‑world rules into tables</li>
                <li>Why normalization reduces anomalies in your data</li>
                <li>Choosing between natural and surrogate keys</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                As this section grows, you’ll find posts tagged as beginner, intermediate, or advanced, so you can quickly
                find the level that matches where you are right now.
